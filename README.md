# SalyProject

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **StudioFraisk** members! This repository is where you can collaborate and contribute to the project. Each member can commit their respective part here to ensure the project's growth and success.

## Important Guidelines

To maintain a clean and organized workflow, please follow these instructions:

1. **Create a New Branch**:
     Before adding or modifying anything in the project, ensure you create a new branch specifically for your changes. This helps in organizing work and avoiding conflicts.
   
2. **Testing by Anis**:
     All contributions should be tested by Anis (aka Sidali.Zerrouati) before being merged. Ensure that your branch is ready for testing before requesting a review.

3. **Do Not Commit to the Main Branch**:
     The `main` branch should remain untouched by direct commits. All changes must go through pull requests after successful testing and approval.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure smoother collaboration and project development!

### Logs will be uploaded on Discord for any-change done in the git

## Commit Message Conventions

To maintain a clear and organized record of changes in the project, we use specific conventions for commit messages. Each message should start with a keyword followed by a brief description of the modification. Here are the keywords used and their meanings:

- **`ADD`**: Used when adding something new to the project (e.g., a file, feature, or resource).
  
- **`UPDATE`**: Used when modifying an existing file or feature, such as an enhancement or adjustment.

- **`FIX`**: Used when resolving a problem or bug.

- **`DELETE`**: Used when deleting a file, feature, or resource.

- **`REFACTOR`**: Used when reorganizing or optimizing code without changing its behavior. This includes code cleanup, improving readability, or rewriting sections.

- **`DOCUMENT`**: Used when adding or updating project documentation.

### Commit Message Format
A good commit message typically follows this format:
1. **Uppercase keyword** (e.g., `ADD`, `UPDATE`, `FIX`, etc.)
2. **A colon separating the keyword and description**.
3. **A brief description of the change**.
4. (Optional) **A detailed description if necessary**.
