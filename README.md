## Important Guidelines

To maintain a clean and organized workflow, please follow these instructions:

1. **Create a New Branch**:
     Before adding or modifying anything in the project, ensure you create a new branch specifically for your changes. This helps in organizing work and avoiding conflicts.
   
2. **Testing by Anis**:
     All contributions should be tested by Anis (aka Sidali.Zerrouati) before being merged. Ensure that your branch is ready for testing before requesting a review.

3. **Do Not Commit to the Main Branch**:
     The `main` branch should remain untouched by direct commits. All changes must go through pull requests after successful testing and approval.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure smoother collaboration and project development!
